# **Creating and preserving a business identity**

A foundational part of protecting the privacy of a business is to separate the business from any personal identifiers. There are several pieces to this. 

- [Phone](#phone-number)
- [Email](#email)
- [Social Media](#social-media)
- [Domain Registration and Webhosting](#domain-registration-and-webhosting)

## Phone Number

A phone number is required for registration of many services. While disposable sms services exist, the frequency of how those websites update is inconsistent and the sites tend to be full of spammy advertisements. Also if one needs to verify their identity a second time for the same acccount (for instance if you find yourself in twitter jail frequently), it is necessary to have the same number to reference. 

To avoid the fiat surveillance system, use a prepaid phone. This is common practice in much of the world, but is less common in the United States. As of this writing, these phones and numbers must be purchased and activated in person. Minutes must be added approximately every 90 days in order to keep the number active. Refills/top-ups may be purchased in person with cash or online with bitcoin. One such service is [Bitrefill]("https://www.bitrefill.com/") which allows purchase of these refills with Lightning Network, adding additional privacy.


## Email

A separate email account should be used for anything related to that business (websites, social media, etc.). If a phone number is required, use the prepaid number from the previous section to activate a privacy focused / pseudonymous email like [Protonmail]("https://protonmail.com"). Protonmail does accept Bitcoin as payment for their higher-tiered offerings, but at the time of this writing one cannot pay to initialize a new address, only to upgrade an existing account. Once you have your email address, you can register social media accounts or whatever else you need for your company with that address and the unlinked phone number. Use this email for things you'll be receiving on a regular basis. For one-off things that require an email address, a disposable, anonymous service like [TenMinuteMail]("https://10minutemail.com") is recommended as a throwaway solution to minimize email spam and tracking.


## Social Media

Social Media is a blessing and a curse. In today's world it is essential for the marketing of your product. As a business owner you must decide where to best spend your efforts as far as which social media platforms get how much of your attention, but know that depending too much on any one platform can be dangerous in the event that your account is locked or banned.

There are no good meteorologists for how the winds of TOS enforcement are blowing at Twitter, YouTube and Facebook on any given day, but the sum of the evidence leans towards suppressing anything that can be construed as different from the mainstream. It would be a good idea to familiarize yourself with Gab and Mastadon in the event that you're forced to use them.

Remember, you have worked hard to create an identity that is serparate from your personal, in-real-life identity. Don't screw this up now with poor social media habits. Don't share something on the company social media and then turn around and be the first person to repost it or smash the like button from your personal account. Don't repost things from your personal account to the work one. These are separate entities, do not associate them. Use a separate browser or at least use icognito mode for each. It would not be a bad idea to use Tor for one or both (on separate circuits) either.

## Domain Registration and Webhosting

Where you *do* have more options is in the realm of webhosting, domain registration and DNS proxies. As services change over time, rather than tell you specific companies to use, here are things to look for in a domain registrar, webhost, and any other third party you are forced to depend on:
1. They don't require identifying information
2. They accept Bitcoin
3. (bonus) They have history of sticking up for free speech or at least ignoring troll mobs
4. (bonus) If state actors are part of your harassment threat model (IRS, ATF, CNN, whatever), consider picking a host outside of their jurisdiction.

1 and 2 are usually a packaged deal. If they ask for a name, see if a pseudonym works. Assuming they take Bitcoin, they probably won't make any effort to verify your identity. If they require a phone number you've got that covered with the burner number. If you find one with 3 and/or 4 that's gravy on top. Even without 3, the worst they can do is cut you off. Not great, but they can't give up your identity.

One last thing on names: protect the names of your suppliers or any other company you deal with upstream of the end client. There's usually not much reason to give these names out anyway, but you want to protect them from harassment and keep them from becoming a way for your enemies to get to you as well.
