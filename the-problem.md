# **The Problem with the Current System**

## The Beauty of Cash

Before digital payments, before debit cards, credit cards, or even checks, people paid for items with cash. While technically today's cash started out as reserve notes for gold, it is assumed that when you pay someone in cash, that transaction is final. The merchant has received their payment in full, and need nothing else from the customer. 

## Limitations of Digital Fiat

While credit cards were not created for this purpose, they enabled the explosion of remote payments, particularly online businesses. However in order to combat credit card fraud, this system allows payments to be made from either end. For example if your credit card is stolen, you can call the provider company and tell them that your card has been stolen. When you tell them which charges were fraudulent, the company then takes that money back from the merchant. This means that merchants are the ones who suffer most from theft and fraud. Of course even this can be taken advantage of, with legitimate purchases being claimed as theft so that the customer doesn't have to pay. In order to protect themselves from fraudulant charges and chargebacks, merchants and processors began collecting additional information, to prove that the person providing the credit card number is the actual owner. Let's call this information, not necessary for the actual processing of the payment, but collected in order to protect other parties, "information collateral". 

## Information Collateral Creates Honeypots

With every store that takes online payments now also collecting this information collateral, gaining access to a store's customer database will give an attacker not just credit card numbers, but also customers' names, addresses, telephone numbers and possibly more. With this information attackers can open new credit card lines or other services. Or take that information and sell it to other nefarious actors multiple times over. Because of this market for customers' personal information, the larger the store, the more desireable they become to attackers. This should motivate stores to to improve their customer data retention practices, but alas this has not been the case. With the rise of customer data analysis and the value of behavior prediction, being a honeypot is just part of the cost of doing business for these stores.

And it isn't just stores. Many banks and all three major credit reporting agencies have been the targets of attacks in various levels of severity, with millions of customers having their data exposed.

## The Rise of Online Business Creates Choke Points

With the ability to run businesses entirely online with no brick-and-mortar presence, companies are absolutely dependant on payment processors. Payment processors (like Paypal and Stripe) are specialized companies licensed as money transmitters that do the actual processing of the payments back and forth. If the payment processor's service goes down, the online merchant cannot receive payment. Or if the payment processor simply decides to drop you as a customer for political reasons. While it is within their rights, if several payment processors do so in a coordinated effort, it becomes increasingly difficult for the merchant to conduct any business. Even worse if it is done as the request or strong urging of the government, as we saw in [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point). If the current government (regardless of which party) decides they disagree with an industry, the banking regulators simply classify that industry as "high risk" for getting audited. Then banks and payment processors simply stop servicing businesses in that industry because the risk of being audited is not worth what gain the may have gotten, especially for small businesses.

## Cancel Culture and Collusion

The proliferation of cancel culture is similar to the above ideas, but with the pressure coming from "woke" mobs on social media. Angry trolls on the internet draw attention to negative aspects (proven or imagined) of an individual or company in order to elicit action by another entity that the undesirable party depends on. For example, the firing of Lori Loughlin from the Hallmark show "When Calls the Heart" after her involvement in the college admissions scandal. The trials are still on-going, but the negative feedback was too much of a risk for Hallmark to wait out the results. Other examples include demanding the apology or firing of professional athletes for idiotic things they said when they were in high-school. The lesson here is that relying on third parties is a security hole. Limiting the number of third parties (including suppliers and hosting services) and fiercely protecting the identies of the ones you must depend on is a crucial part of sovereignty from the outrage mob.

## Bitcoin Fixes This

Bitcoin is a push only system. They customer can only send bitcoin to the recipient, and cannot reverse the payment at a later date. There is much debate on how many confirmations are required to consider a payment settled, but that comes down to individual risk models and is beyond the scope of this framework. Assuming, however that a payment has been confirmed your preferred number of times, that payment is final and cannot be taken back. There are no chargebacks. There are no bailouts. Since there is no risk to the merchant of chargebacks, there is no need to collect information collateral. While it is impossible to say that this will prevent your business from being attacked, making it public knowledge that you do not collect this data may help make your site less desireable to potential attackers and helps protect your customers, should your site actually be compromised.
