## Introduction

The current fiat system allows and often encourages financial surveillance and financial censorship. It also requires the collection of massive amounts of information that can be used for doxxing, harrassing and deplatforming individuals and groups. By using Bitcoin for payments, combined with behaviors and services that you control, this surveillane and harrassment can be avoided.
