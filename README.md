## Introduction

The current fiat system allows and often encourages financial surveillance and financial censorship. It also requires the collection of massive amounts of information that can be used for doxxing, harrassing and deplatforming individuals and groups. This makes conducting digital payments and ecommerce difficult, especially if the goods, services or spirit of the business are viewed as distasteful or controversial. By using Bitcoin for payments, combined with behaviors and services that you control, this surveillance and harrassment can be avoided. This framework is a coming-together of many existing ideas to simplify the process of getting an online business off the ground without compromising the privacy of the creators in the beginning. For more on the problems of the current fiat surveillance system and outrage culture, see [The Problem](the-problem.md)

## Identity

It is essential to protect the personal identity of all parties involved as this is the information that your adversaries are seeking in order to force you to bend to their will. Buy a prepaid phone with cash and then use this number for verification of other online services, including email, social media, domain registry and webhosting. For more details see [Identity](identity.md).

## Bitcoin

This framework relies on the finality and push-only nature of Bitcoin payments. This finality means that payment processors and stores do not need "information collateral" AKA personally identifying information to protect them from fraud and chargebacks. This means that even if pressure is put on those you depend on, they don't have that information to give up. For a deeper explanation of this, see [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md)

## Open Source Stack

While you will likely be forced to depend on others for some aspects of your business (supplies, webhosting, etc.), having your bitcoin never in the custody of another party and all of the code on your website be open source limits potential attack vectors. This can be accomplished using WordPress with WooCommerce for your store website, with BTCPay Server for your Bitcoin payment processing. Take a deeper look at [The Stack](the-stack.md).


## Mail and Shipping

The physical shipping of goods is probably the weakest point in this framework because shipping providers are limited and mailbox providers do take on a certain risk by providing you with a place to receive and store items. Although there is little getting around giving these providers your real name, using a P.O. box or other receiving address avoids putting your physical home address out there to be found and there are ways to send and receive to these addresses with pseudonyms. To find out more, see [Mail and Shipping](mail-shipping.md)

## Blockchain Surveillance 

The auditability of Bitcoin's blockchain is both a blessing and a curse. For the first time, we can see and validate the total money supply, and yet this also means that without extra effort, everyone's transactions are very public. Check out [Blockchain Surveillance](blockchain-surveillance.md) for more information on how your identity can be compromised based on your transaction behaviors and technologies that exist to help mitigate this.

## Data Retention

Hopefully your business projects an ethos of respecting your customers, including their privacy. It would be really great if your customers didn't have to trust you, but could verify for themselves that you were removing their information when you no longer needed it. While there is no way yet to present this information directly wihout compromising the security of your website, the [Data Retention Board](data-retention-board.md) presents an idea on how to give some transparency to which invoices(and their accompanying information) are still stored on your website at any given moment. 

## Customer education

Depending on your target audience, you may have to do varying levels of education about Bitcoin and privacy technologies and techniques to your customers. [Customer Education](customer-education.md) presents ideas for helping walk your customers through these steps.
