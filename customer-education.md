# Customer Education

Depending on the business you are running and your intended customers, it may be necessary to teach them how and why Bitcoin is used for purchasing, and how they can acquire it. This github repository or the original [Medium article]() announcing it are great places to start. Other resources include:

There are multiple approaches to acquiring Bitcoin. Some believe you should only purchase peer to peer with cash through something like [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com) or [Bisq](https://bisq.network). Other think it is enough to acquire your Bitcoin through an exchange like [CashApp](https://cash.app) or [Kraken](https://kraken.com) and then send the coins through a mixer like Samourai Wallet's [Whirlpool](https://samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool).

Ultimately the customer will make their own choice, but it is good to make the effort to educate them and give them the resources to make the best decision for themselves.
